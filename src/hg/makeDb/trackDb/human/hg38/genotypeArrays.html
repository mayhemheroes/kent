<P>
Agilent's oligonucleotide CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridization) platform enables the
study of genome-wide DNA copy number changes at a high resolution. The CGH probes on Agilent
CGH microarrays are 60-mer oligonucleotides synthesized in situ using Agilent's inkjet
SurePrint technology. The probes represented on the Agilent CGH microarrays have been
selected using algorithms developed specifically for the CGH application, assuring optimal
performance of these probes in detecting DNA copy number changes.

<h3>Illumina 450k and 850k Methylation Arrays</h3>
<p>
With the <a href="https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/microarray-kits/infinium-methylation-epic.html"
target="_blank">Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Kit</a>, researchers can interrogate over 850,000
methylation sites quantitatively across the genome at single-nucleotide resolution. Multiple
samples, including FFPE, can be analyzed in parallel to deliver high-throughput power while
minimizing the cost per sample. These tracks show postions being measured on the Illumina 450k and
850k (EPIC) microarray tracks. More information about the arrays can be found on the
<a href="https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/microarray-kits/infinium-methylation-epic.html"
target="_blank">Infinium MethylationEPIC Kit</a> website.

<h3>Illumina CytoSNP 850K Probe Array</h3>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/clinical-research-products/infinium-cytosnp-850k.html"
target="_blank">Infinium CytoSNP-850K v1.2 BeadChip</a> provides comprehensive coverage of
cytogenetically relevant genes on a proven platform, helping researchers find valuable information
that may be missed by other technologies. It contains approximately 850,000 empirically selected
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the entire genome with enriched coverage for 3,262
genes of known cytogenetics relevance in both constitutional and cancer applications.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The Agilent arrays were downloaded from their 
<a href="https://earray.chem.agilent.com/suredesign/search.htm" 
target="_blank">Agilent SureDesign</a> website tool on March 2022.</p>
<p>
The Illumina EPIC and 450K array tracks were created using a few columns from the
<a href="https://support.illumina.com/array/array_kits/infinium-methylationepic-beadchip-kit/downloads.html"
target="_blank">Infinium MethylationEPIC v1.0 B5 Manifest File (CSV Format)</a>
and was then converted into a bigBed.</p>
<p>
The Illumina CytoSNP-850K track was created by downloading the
<a href="https://webdata.illumina.com/downloads/productfiles/cytosnp-850k/v1-2/cytosnp-850k-v1-2-ns550-d2-manifest-file-csv.zip"
target="_blank">CytoSNP-850K v1.2 Manifest File (CSV Format) (GRCh38)</a> file and then converted
into a bigBed file.
